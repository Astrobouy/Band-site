        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Bob Marley and the Wailers (also known as Bob Marley & the Wailers or The Wailers) were a Jamaican reggae
            band led by Bob Marley. It developed from the earlier ska vocal group, The Wailers, created by Peter Tosh,
            Marley, and Bunny Wailer in 1963. By late 1963 singers Junior Braithwaite, Beverley Kelso, and Cherry Smith
            had joined on. By the early 1970s, Marley and Bunny Wailer had learned to play some instruments, and
            brothers Aston "Family Man" Barrett (bass) and Carlton Barrett (drums), had joined the band. After Bunny
            Wailer and Peter Tosh left the band in 1974, Marley began touring with new band members as Bob Marley and
            the Wailers. His new backing band included the Barrett brothers, Junior Marvin and Al Anderson on lead
            guitar, Tyrone Downie and Earl "Wya" Lindo on keyboards, and Alvin "Seeco" Patterson on percussion. The "I
            Threes", consisting of Judy Mowatt, Marcia Griffiths, and Marley's wife, Rita, provided backing vocals.</p>

        <p>Bob Marley and the Wailers, Peter Tosh, and Bunny Wailer all enjoyed considerable success as reggae music
            continued to gain popularity during the 1970s and 1980s. One of the last performances that included Marley
            was in 1980 at Madison Square Garden. Several of the group's members have died subsequent to Marley's death
            in 1981: Carlton Barrett and Tosh (both murdered) in 1987, Braithwaite (also murdered) in 1999, Smith in
            2008,[8] Earl Lindo in 2017,[9] and Wailer in 2021. Beverley Kelso, Constantine "Dream" Walker and Aston
            "Family Man" Barrett are the only surviving members of the group's original line-up.</p>
